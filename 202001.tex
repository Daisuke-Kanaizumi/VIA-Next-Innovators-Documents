\opening{Dear Sir or Madam,}\\
Welcome to the VIA Next Innovators website. We strongly desire that everyone will have a happy new year \& decade. Due to the assistance of many people including members from the VIA headquarters, this year is our 5th anniversary. In these 5 years, there were many changes to our environment that were NOT expected in the "VIA Next Innovators Articles of Incorporation" since 2015, which is on our website.
\begin{center}
\texttt{https://sites.google.com/a/viaprograms.org/via-next-innovators-homepage/english-version}
\end{center}
\par
The biggest change is that we are NOT holding regular meetings, as mentioned in the articles of incorporation. This is because we are facing to shortage of resources (members, finance, time $\cdots$). But there is no need for concern because we can discuss anything by using Skype, Zoom, Slack, or anything else when necessity has arose.
\par
But please be careful. We want to emphasize that no meetings does NOT mean no activities. In the beginning of our operations, we were holding supplementary ESI/DSI sessions behalf of VIA headquarters. But currently, we don't have to this because the technology of webinars has advanced. Instead, we are focusing on distributing our knowledge that we obtained in the duration of the ESI/DSI programs, post-program learning and our previous operations. As a part of our knowledge distribution, we have not only updated our website, but we also joined knowledge sharing platforms such as Slideshare, SpeakerDeck, and Slides.

\end{center}
These are just a top of an iceberg. In the 2020s, we will pursue what we can do for VIA and the rest of the world by one laptop, one iPad, and one smartphone. Thanks to the rapid technical advancements in the previous decade, a single device is enough to make social impact.
\par
As described as above, many things around us have changed, but VIA Next Innovators has NEVER changed its Vision \& Mission (contained in our website) since the 2015 kickoff (And we have NO plans to do that). We will always and continue to reach our goals at the best of our abilities.
\par
\closing{Yours Sincerely,}
