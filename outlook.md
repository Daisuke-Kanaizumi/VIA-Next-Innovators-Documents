# Backgrounds of Establishment & Activity Continuation
====================================================

Our society is facing numerous difficult social tasks such as
religious/ethnic/military confliction, WMD, terrorism, dictatorship,
racism, poverty, destruction of nature, natural disasters, lack of
effective support for developing countries, human rights protection,
etc. Fortunately, some brave activists are already taking actions to
solve certain social issues depending on their interest, but the number
of change-makers is totally not enough. On the other hand, it is
extremely difficult (maybe impossible) for a single person to take
action to solve various types of social issues, but that does not mean
that he/she can ignore the problems that he/she is not directly related.
Therefore, our society is strongly/immediately requiring more
change-makers who have passion, vision, knowledge, and compassion to
solve social issues.

In July 2015, VIA Next Innovators was founded by Japanese members who
completed ESI or DSI (programs focused on social
innovation, entrepreneurship,
leadership, design-thinking, etc.)
offered by VIA (Volunteers in Asia, or VIA Programs), a non-profit
501(c) organization based in San Francisco, United States. In
partnership/cooperation/discussion with VIA, VIA Next Innovators aims at
developing/maintaining/expanding a strong professional network of social
innovators that will help our society and allow people to reach their
potentials. By taking such actions, we will contribute in order to lead
the global society in a good way.

As an organization with the `viaprograms.org` domain, VIA Next
Innovators will support and assist VIA.

## Notes about the Articles of Incorporation
-----------------------------------------

The Articles of Incorporation has been valid since our establishment.
But since 5 years have passed since the kickoff, some parts of the rules
do NOT suit to social trends and the current status of VIA Next
Innovators. For example, the 1st version was demanding attendance to
regular meetings at meeting rooms. But currently there any many ways to
hold online meetings (Skype, Slack, Zoom, etc.). We will only show the
rules that still suits to our team. We have also fixed English mistakes
within the help of Grammarly.
